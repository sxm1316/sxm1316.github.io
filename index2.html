<h1>Latitude vs. Temperature (Farenheit)</h1>
<p>
This plot demonstrates a trend in randomly selected cities by latitudinal location,
plotted on the x-axis, vs maximum temperature of that city in degrees Farenheit on the y-axis.
There appears to be a generally negative trend; as city Latitude increases,
temperature decreases. More accurately, as latitude gets closer to the equator,
temeratures increase. This is a reasonable conclusion to draw, and an expected prediction.
The further a city is from the Earth's equator, the more likley that city will be colder.
