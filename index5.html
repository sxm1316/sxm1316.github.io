<h1>Latitude vs. Wind Speed (Miles Per Hour)</h1>
<p>
Further analysis is required to determine statistical significance of 
the slightly positive trend that emerges as latitude increases with regards
to wind speed. NASA identifies global wind patterns by latitude accordingly; "Trade Winds"
at 30 degrees North and South of the equator, "Prevailing Westerlies" between 40 to 60 
degrees in both hemispheres and "Polar Easterlies" at 50 to 60 degrees in both hemisperes.
