<p>Previewed in the following pages are comparisons and visualizations of 
    different variables pertaining to weather data throughout several cities.
    OpenWeatherMap API was deployed as a resource for extracting weather 
    information from cities by latitude. From data collected through the API, factors such as cloudiness,
    humidity, temperature and wind speed were extrapolated and produced into Pandas
    data frames and manipulated into visuals via Matplotlib. Click on a visualization 
    below for a closer look at these metrics.</p>
