    <h1>Latitude vs. Percent Humidity</h1>
    <p>
    There is no apparent correlation in humidity and city location, as depicted by this graphical
    visualization. Humidity is most remarkable in tropical locations, which are located sporadically
    throughout the globe (wikipedia.org). This means there would be no predictable
    trend in humidity by latitude location.
