<h1>Latitude vs. Percent Cloudiness</h1>
<p>
Cloudiness is not generally predictable and for any location relative to one another.
As a stand-alone descriptor, "cloudiness" is vaguly defined. However, wikipedia defines the "okta" as
"a unit of measurement used to describe the amount of cloud cover at any given location 
such as a weather station. Sky conditions are estimated in terms of how many eighths of the sky are covered in cloud, 
ranging from 0 oktas (completely clear sky) through to 8 oktas (completely overcast)"(wikipedi.org). </p>
